# MSCKF\_VIO

Modified version of [KumarRobotics/msckf_vio](https://github.com/KumarRobotics/msckf_vio) (commit e3a39a9 on Jul 26, 2019), a stereo version of MSCKF.

The software takes in synchronized stereo images and IMU messages and generates real-time 6DOF pose estimation of the IMU frame.

* tested on Ubuntu 16.04 with ROS Kinetic
* Paper Draft: *[Robust Stereo Visual Inertial Odometry for Fast Autonomous Flight](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.00036)*


## Build

```sh
mkdir -p ws_msckf/src
cd ws_msckf/src
git clone xxx
cd ../
catkin_make --pkg msckf_vio --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
```

## Run

* run with MH_01_easy.bag
  ```sh
  roslaunch msckf_vio msckf_vio_euroc.launch
  rviz -d rviz_euroc_config.rviz
  ```

* run with MYNTEYE-S1030 (Stereo + IMU)
  ```sh
  roslaunch msckf_vio msckf_vio_mynteye_s1030.launch [rviz:=true]
  ```

## Calibration

An accurate calibration is crucial for successfully running the software. To get the best performance of the software, the stereo cameras and IMU should be hardware synchronized. Note that for the stereo calibration, which includes the camera intrinsics, distortion, and extrinsics between the two cameras, you have to use a calibration software. **Manually setting these parameters will not be accurate enough.** [Kalibr](https://github.com/ethz-asl/kalibr) can be used for the stereo calibration and also to get the transformation between the stereo cameras and IMU. The yaml file generated by Kalibr can be directly used in this software. See calibration files in the `config` folder for details. The two calibration files in the `config` folder should work directly with the EuRoC and [fast flight](https://github.com/KumarRobotics/msckf_vio/wiki) datasets. The convention of the calibration file is as follows:

`camx/T_cam_imu`: takes a vector from the IMU frame to the camx frame.
`cam1/T_cn_cnm1`: takes a vector from the cam0 frame to the cam1 frame.

The filter uses the first 200 IMU messages to initialize the gyro bias, acc bias, and initial orientation. Therefore, the robot is required to start from a stationary state in order to initialize the VIO successfully.


## EuRoC and UPenn Fast flight dataset example usage

First obtain either the [EuRoC](https://projects.asl.ethz.ch/datasets/doku.php?id=kmavvisualinertialdatasets) or the [UPenn fast flight](https://github.com/KumarRobotics/msckf_vio/wiki/Dataset) dataset.

Recommended EuRoC ROS Bags:
- [Vicon Room 1 01](http://robotics.ethz.ch/~asl-datasets/ijrr_euroc_mav_dataset/vicon_room1/V1_01_easy/V1_01_easy.bag)
- [Vicon Room 1 02](http://robotics.ethz.ch/~asl-datasets/ijrr_euroc_mav_dataset/vicon_room1/V1_02_easy/V1_02_easy.bag)

Once the `msckf_vio` is built and sourced (via `source <path to catkin_ws>/devel/setup.bash`), there are two launch files prepared for the [EuRoC](https://projects.asl.ethz.ch/datasets/doku.php?id=kmavvisualinertialdatasets) and [UPenn fast flight](https://github.com/KumarRobotics/msckf_vio/wiki/Dataset) dataset named `msckf_vio_euroc.launch` and `msckf_vio_fla.launch` respectively. Each launch files instantiates two ROS nodes:

* `image_processor` processes stereo images to detect and track features
* `vio` obtains feature measurements from the `image_processor` and tightly fuses them with the IMU messages to estimate pose.

These launch files can be executed via

```
roslaunch msckf_vio msckf_vio_euroc.launch
```
or

```
roslaunch msckf_vio msckf_vio_fla.launch
```

Once the nodes are running you need to run the dataset rosbags (in a different terminal), for example:

```
rosbag play V1_01_easy.bag
```

As mentioned in the previous section, **The robot is required to start from a stationary state in order to initialize the VIO successfully.**

To visualize the pose and feature estimates you can use the provided rviz configurations found in `msckf_vio/rviz` folder (EuRoC: `rviz_euroc_config.rviz`, Fast dataset: `rviz_fla_config.rviz`).


## ROS Nodes

### `image_processor` node

**Subscribed Topics**

`imu` (`sensor_msgs/Imu`)

IMU messages is used for compensating rotation in feature tracking, and 2-point RANSAC.

`cam[x]_image` (`sensor_msgs/Image`)
